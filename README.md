## The Games

### Catch the Light

If you ever played in an arcade, you must have seen the game with a lot of red lights and a button. The lights will light in sequence and you press the button and hope the light stop at the top. If your timing is right, then you get a lot of tickets. Well, this game is a mini version of that.
