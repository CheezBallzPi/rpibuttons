## Purpose

This game is created during Weldon Ridge Raspbarry Pi Programming Camp 2016.
The purpose of the camp is to provide an interactive workshop that inspire 
highschool students into CS, EE, and math. 

We create games on the Raspberry Pi because it's fun (and educational)!!!

This repository will contain an example program and some helpful documents.

## The Hardware

The hardware is simple. There are 8 LED lights, a buzzer and a button.

## The Games

### Catch the Light

If you ever played in an arcade, you must have seen the game with a lot of red lights and a button. The lights will light in sequence and you press the button and hope the light stop at the top. If your timing is right, then you get a lot of tickets. Well, this game is a mini version of that.
